# PreformancePlayground
## The Idea
I like simple tools. I like tinkering. I like preformance. So, simple preformance playground
## Usage
* paste your code into the `sample` function
* run `g++ playground.cpp && ./a.out` , you can switch up the compiler if you want :)
* improve your code by playing around
* repeat
